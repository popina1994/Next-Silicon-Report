\section{Introduction}
This report contains the responses to the tasks stated in the home project pdf.
It is accompanied with the repository that contains reproducible solutions with the installation instructions alongside: experiments and tests according to the task requirements.
\section{Code Analysis and Documentation}
In this section we analyze the existing code shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:sine_existing}.

\subsection{The Existing Implementation: Code Drawbacks}
The code is written for C and follows the following bad practices:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reusing the variable multiple times,  \texttt{(float)M\_PI} and \texttt{2.0f * (float)M\_PI}, (lines \ref{alg:sine_ex:ln:fmodf}, \ref{alg:sine_ex:ln:xGreater}, \ref{alg:sine_ex:ln:xLess}, \ref{alg:sine_ex:ln:xLess}, \ref{alg:sine_ex:ln:xMinus}, \ref{alg:sine_ex:ln:xPi} of Algorithm \ref{alg:sine_existing});
    \item Not using auto in order to automatically deduce types since the results of all the statements are known;
    \item Cleaning if loop to be more understandable: \texttt{fmodf} returns the result in the range $(-2 \pi, 2 \pi)$. Then, now it is obvious that one checks whether the number is outside of the range $[-\pi, \pi]$, and then updates \textbf{x} for $2 \pi$ period, so the method works from the number in the range $[-\pi, \pi]$;
    \item Adding more verbosity ();
    \item Reusing variable names -> more verbose names should be used in order to improve readability of the code. The c ompiler will optimize for the least number of variables/registers to be used;
    \item Renaming function names and migrating these functions to the corresponding headers and sources that would contain the custom maths functions.
\end{enumerate}
